whmcs-torblock

A simple WHMCS module for blocking TOR traffic to the clientarea.

Compatible with WHMCS 6/7


Installation:

copy both files into your modules/addons folder, for example:

modules/addons/torblock

Activate it in WHMCS Adminarea and thatÂ´s it.

By default, this will redirect all TOR Traffic to google.com, but you can change the target in the modules config.
There is no user output, so no need to set access control.

Enjoy.
